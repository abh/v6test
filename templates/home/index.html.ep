<h2>IPv6/IPv4 connectivity test system</h2>

<p>This project is testing web
users' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">IPv4</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> connectivity.
The goals are to track the adoption of IPv6 and the number of users
who have trouble connecting to servers with both A and AAAA records.</p>

<dl class="faq">
<dt>What are the current statistics?</dt>
<dd> See the global <a href="/statistics">statistics page</a>. </dd>

<dt>How can I help?</dt>
<dd> Create <a href="/account">an account</a> and install the
     javascript widget on your site. </dd>

<dt>How does the system work?</dt>
<dd> A bit of javascript inserts image tags for three 1x1 pixel gifs. The images
     are hosted on servers with IPv4 only, IPv6 and IPv6+IPv4 DNS records.  The
     javascript sends the results back to the server.
</dd>

<dt>What information is tracked?</dt>
<dd> The response time of each image request and the (external/public)
     IPs the user used to access the test server.  We also store the
     'http referer', the ID of the site, the time of the test.  The
     javascript sets a 'v6uq' cookie in your domain for 28 days to
     prevent the test from running more than about once a month per
     user.  The value of this cookie is also stored.
</dd>

<dt> What information is made public? </dt>
<dd> The statistics from any one site are only used in aggregate for
     the global statistics unless the site owner enables "public
     statistics" for the site.
</dd>

<dt>Is the code for the system available?</dt>

<dd> Yes, it is <a href="http://git.develooper.com/?p=v6test.git;a=summary">in git</a>. </dd>
